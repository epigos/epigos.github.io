I have been programming over the last 6 years and I have built several apps, the most remarkably ones are church database system to manage members data as well sending SMS to members, and a social networking site for my friends back in college.

I was also part of the mastermind team were we built and operated the-ghana-guide.com, a travelers information guide to Ghana. We also provided bulk SMS, online marketing and SEO to SME's in Ghana. MasterMind was selected as one of the best-run student companies in the world by the Kairos Society.

Am currently working with the [Ahonya.com][1] team, the amazon of Africa.
